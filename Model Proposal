Model Proposal for [Project Name]
Your Name

Course ID: CMPLXSYS 530,
Course Title: Computer Modeling of Complex Systems
Term: Winter, 2019
 

Goal
Provide a short, 1-3 sentence description of the goal of your model

 

Justification
Short explanation on why you are using ABM

 

Main Micro-level Processes and Macro-level Dynamics of Interest
Short overview of the key processes and/or relationships you are interested in using your model to explore. Will likely be something regarding emergent behavior that arises from individual interactions

 

Model Outline
 

1) Environment
Description of the environment in your model. Things to specify if they apply:

Boundary conditions (e.g. wrapping, infinite, etc.)
Dimensionality (e.g. 1D, 2D, etc.)
List of environment-owned variables (e.g. resources, states, roughness)
List of environment-owned methods/procedures (e.g. resource production, state change, etc.)
# Include first pass of the code you are thinking of using to construct your environment
# This may be a set of "patches-own" variables and a command in the "setup" procedure, a list, an array, or Class constructor
# Feel free to include any patch methods/procedures you have. Filling in with pseudocode is ok! 
# NOTE: If using Netlogo, remove "python" from the markdown at the top of this section to get a generic code block
 

2) Agents
Description of the "agents" in the system. Things to specify if they apply:

List of agent-owned variables (e.g. age, heading, ID, etc.)
List of agent-owned methods/procedures (e.g. move, consume, reproduce, die, etc.)
# Include first pass of the code you are thinking of using to construct your agents
# This may be a set of "turtle-own" variables and a command in the "setup" procedure, a list, an array, or Class constructor
# Feel free to include any agent methods/procedures you have so far. Filling in with pseudocode is ok! 
# NOTE: If using Netlogo, remove "python" from the markdown at the top of this section to get a generic code block
 

3) Action and Interaction
Interaction Topology

Description of the topology of who interacts with whom in the system. Perfectly mixed? Spatial proximity? Along a network? CA neighborhood?

Action Sequence

What does an agent, cell, etc. do on a given turn? Provide a step-by-step description of what happens on a given turn for each part of your model

Step 1
Step 2
Etc...
 

4) Model Parameters and Initialization
Describe and list any global parameters you will be applying in your model.

Describe how your model will be initialized

Provide a high level, step-by-step description of your schedule during each "tick" of the model

 

5) Assessment and Outcome Measures
What quantitative metrics and/or qualitative features will you use to assess your model outcomes?

 

6) Parameter Sweep
What parameters are you most interested in sweeping through? What value ranges do you expect to look at for your analysis?
